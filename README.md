This is a simple guessing game that used the JS date object to calculate how many minutes I have been alive. It then uses a user prompt to compare a user's guess to that value and output a simple yes or no.

Now has the option to quit, and has been reworked to instead have the user guess how long they have been alive based on input of their birthday and time.
